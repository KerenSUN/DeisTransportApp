Welcome to the Brandvan App! This is a voice-controlled app that interfaces with
Brandeis shuttles and vans. Our ultimate goal with this app is to make the user experience
with transportation provided by the school more positive and less frustrating.

Here are a few things we wish to accomplish:
1. Require user authentication in order to use the app.
2. Create a database for each user in order to analyze the most frequent commands
   used by the user, as well as to keep track of their most frequent stops.
3. Create a database to store branvan reservation requests so that our app knows
   to queue those requests and send them to the server right when a reservation is
   allowed to be made (one hour before the desired branvan arrives)
4. Connect our app to the Brandeis Transportation page
   (http://www.brandeis.edu/publicsafety/van-shuttle/index.html) in order for our program
   to return back to the user the expected/scheduled time of arrival for certain shuttles
   and vans.
5. Connect our app to the Brandeis Shuttle tracker operated by TransLoc in order for our
   program to return back to the user the estimated time of arrival for certain shuttles
   and vans.
