[![Heroku deployed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Heroku-Deployed-8363A8.svg)]

Welcome to Deis Transport! This app is created by a group of Brandeis students who believes that the shuttle and van system provided by Brandeis University can be significantly improved. Our goal is to create one fast and easy to use system that allows students to take advantage of Brandeis' transportation services.

## Features 

Our app contains both a GUI component as well as a VUI component. With our app, users are able to look up schedules for certain vans or shuttles, track the vehicles in real-time, and make reservations. For drivers of the school branvans we have created a special page that allows them to look up the list of individuals who have made a reservation.
